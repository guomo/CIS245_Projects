    Description :   Your program will use the inheritance diagram from this week in order to create a parent class and two child classes.
                    Your program will prompt the user to create at least one object of each type (Car and Pickup). Using a menu system and 
                    capturing user input your program will allow the user the choice of adding a car or pickup truck and define the vehicle's 
                    attributes. The program will use user input to define the vehicle's attributes. The options attribute in the parent class 
                    must be a python list containing a minimum of eight (8) options common to all vehicles. (i.e. power mirrors, power locks, 
                    remote start, backup camera, bluetooth, cruise control, etc). The user will choose from a list of options to add to the 
                    vehicle's options list and can must choose a minimum of one vehicle option per vehicle. When the user is finished adding 
                    vehicles to their virtual garage the program will output the vehicles in their garage and their attributes.
