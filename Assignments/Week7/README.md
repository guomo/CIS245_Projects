# Week 7 • Git, Peers, and Drafts
This folder contains all the submissions for week 7. Plus a bonus of a fully completed final class project. 

### Git repo
I actually have had my account git account for years and have been paying for the Github Pro tier for my personal stuff. This particular repo I created in the second week of the course to keep all my code off my mac in a safe place. *So here it is!*

### peerReviewFixed.py
This file is assignment 7.2 and submitted as part of assigment 7.1 to create the repo.

### Open Weather Class Project
The flow of the final project is shown below:

The file ClassProject-draft.py is really a complete working program that mostly follows the above flow chart.
To run type `python ClassProject-draft.py` in a terminal or cmd shell.
